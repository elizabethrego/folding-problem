folding-problem
===============

Some say you can only create ~7 or 8 folds in a piece of paper. That's not really true, just practically true. With a long enough piece of paper, you can create a much larger number of folds. It's been said that folding a piece of paper 103 times would create a thickness about as large as the observable universe. But how long would that piece of paper need to be in the first place?
